          If you haven&apos;t figured it out already, here&apos;s how you create

          ChordPic has 3 main sections: The <em>Editor</em>, the <em>Result</em>{" "}

          As the name suggests, in the editor section you edit you chord chart.
          Every change of the chord chart is done in this section! More on this
          section later.

          simply connect the strings with the mouse or if you&apos;re on mobile
          you can swipe from one string to another with your finger. To remove
          the bare chord simply click anywhere on the fret with the barre chord

          Colors&quot; button at the bottom of the editor section. After that,

          of the images can vary and depend on what your chart looks like. The
          width will always stay the same though, no matter what your chart
          looks like.
